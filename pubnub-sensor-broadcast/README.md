# Sensor Broadcast using Pubnub and Evothings Studio

This example demonstrates the use of Pubnub as 1:many multicast cloud for realtime IoT apps.</p>
	<p>You will need 3 mobile phones for this example to work. One of them will work just as a subscriber
	while other two will work as publishers and subscribers to the multicast. Modify index.html to change the
	names of mobile phone manufacturers (according to your own availability) or create another condition such 
	as distinguishing on the basis of UUID of the mobile phone.<p>
